        <h3 class="letra">Hello, my name is Willian, I am Colombian and I have been living in Chile for two years, I lived in Los Angeles for a while, I currently live in Santiago, since I arrived my life has changed; the people, the words, the customs and what was most difficult for me to assimilate, the food.
        With my mother we have lived several adventures full of adrenaline and fear, we have traveled to various places in the country, such as Temuco, Antuco, Chill√°n, Quintero, etc.
        All very beautiful but very cold places, especially the sea, when I went I could not resist diving a lot, it was very cold. In the school part I have not done very well since I have always been studying badly, but now that it is the last school year I have to make a great effort, at least to go out and continue studying at the university.
